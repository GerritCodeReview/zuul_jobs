      Base job for building Gerrit

      This job sets up any supplied repos which are required for any
      kind of gerrit-related build (plugins or Gerrit itself).

      However, it does not include all of the required repos; for
      that, see :zuul:job:`gerrit-base` which inherits from this and
      adds branch-appropriate required-projects.
    pre-run: playbooks/gerrit-setup/pre.yaml

      bazelisk.  However, it does not include all of the required
      repos; for that, see :zuul:job:`gerrit-build` which inherits
      from this and adds required-projects.
