      Base job for building Gerrit

      This job sets up any supplied repos which are required for any
      kind of gerrit-related build (plugins or Gerrit itself).

      However, it does not include all of the required repos; for
      that, see :zuul:job:`gerrit-base` which inherits from this and
      adds branch-appropriate required-projects.

      Build Gerrit

      This job sets up submodule repos in a Gerrit tree and runs
      bazelisk.  However, it does not include all of the required
      repos; for that, see :zuul:job:`gerrit-build` which inherits
      from this and adds required-projects.

      Responds to these variables:

      .. zuul:jobvar:: baselisk_targets

         The bazelisk targets to build.  Defaults to ":release".

      .. zuul:jobvar:: baselisk_test_targets

         The bazelisk targets to test.

      Builds a Gerrit plugin in-tree

      Responds to these variables:

         The name of the plugin to build.  Defaults to the project
         under test, but can be specified explicitly to build
         cross-repo.

      .. zuul:jobvar:: baselisk_targets

         The bazelisk targets to build.  Defaults to the gerrit_plugin
         specified above.

         The bazelisk targets to test.  Defaults to
