As gitiles is (now) known to return code 4, I mean.\n\nNote though, gitiles became core only from the stable-3.0 branch and up. But stable-2.16 will soon become EOL (next month). However automated CI will likely remain for it, for some time. There are other core plugins which started that earlier and have no tests.",
