      "message": "Indeed, once we have this working at all, I think it will be time to optimize some things.\n\nIt looks like the current CI splits build and test into two different jobs?  Can you run bazelisk test without running bazelisk build first?  If so, we could do that here.  The build alone in this environment is taking about 20 minutes, so that would help a lot.",
