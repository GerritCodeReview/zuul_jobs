      "message": "@James, @Clark, once upstream change is merged, we would still want to pass java_version: 8 for plugin build on stable-3.4 branch.\n\nThis project doesn\u0027t have any branches yet. Am I understanding correctly, that we would create stable-3.4 branch for this project and override java_version: 8 in ensure-java role and then Zuul would do the right thing, and will fetch the right branch for plugin build on stable-34 branch?\n\nOr would we need to do something special for that in Zuul toolchain on gerrit-review, or even change every plugin repository on stable-3.4 branch to achieve that?\n\nNeedless to say, when we do that, we would revert this commit when merging up to master.",
