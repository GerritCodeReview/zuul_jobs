      "message": "Why are we testing javatests and Polygerrit in the same time? Those are different checkers, right? The same applies to ReviewDb and NoteDb: different checkers. I assumed that the job can retrieve the checker name and build only what it supposed to build. Or am I missing something here?\n\nLooking at this change on stable-2.16 branch: [1]. It has 4 different checks:\n\n* Build/Tests: Builds the code base and executes unit/integration tests\n* Code Style: Executes Code Style tests\n* PolyGerrit UI Tests: Executes unit/integration tests for PolyGerrit UI\n* ReviewDb Build/Tests: Using ReviewDb, builds the code base and executes unit/integration tests\n\nMoreover, RBE javatests are passing now with this pending change: [2], so this could be also alternative: [3] to local build and test execution. :release build is still failing on master, since move to npm and ES6 modules in PolyGerrit toolchain, though: [4].\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/258926\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/260873\n* [3] http://paste.openstack.org/show/791287\n* [4] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d12511",
