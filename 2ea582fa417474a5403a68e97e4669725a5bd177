I assumed that the job can retrieve the checker name and build only what it supposed to build. Or am I missing something here?\n\nLooking at this change on stable-2.16 branch: [1]. It has 4 different checks:\n\n* Build/Tests: Builds the code base and executes unit/integration tests\n* Code Style: Executes Code Style tests\n* PolyGerrit UI Tests: Executes unit/integration tests for PolyGerrit UI\n* ReviewDb Build/Tests: Using ReviewDb, builds the code base and executes unit/integration tests\n\nMoreover, RBE javatests are passing now with this pending change: [2], so this could be also alternative: [3] to local build and test execution. :release build is still failing on master, since move to npm and ES6 modules in PolyGerrit toolchain, though: [4].\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/258926\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/260873\n* [3] http://paste.openstack.org/show/791287\n* [4] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d12511",

I assumed that the job can retrieve the checker name and build only what it supposed to build. Or am I missing something here?\n\nI\u0027m working from what I think are the relevant files in gerrit-ci-scripts.  This is a direct copy from[1].  I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s structured that way, but to get something working, I thought we should start with that.  Of course, we can make whatever jobs we want here.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit-ci-scripts/+/refs/heads/master/jenkins/gerrit-bazel-test.sh\n\n\u003e Moreover, RBE javatests are passing now with this pending change: [2], so this could be also alternative: [3] to local build and test execution. :release build is still failing on master, since move to npm and ES6 modules in PolyGerrit toolchain, though: [4].\n\nI agree that RBE could be interesting in the future, but I don\u0027t think we should switch to RBE because we can\u0027t get the simple shell script version of this working.  Whatever optimizations we use later, I hope we all agree that any developer should be able to check out a copy of Gerrit, build it, and run its test suite on a clean machine with a series of simple well-defined commands.",
